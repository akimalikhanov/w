    "In this short (compared to Feature Engineering one) notebook, I'll continue data preparation process. Here I'll try to \"filter down\" bloated dataset that we got at the end of previous notebook. Various techniques will be applied to select most useful for prediction features. Feature Selection should not be neglected, as one can benefit from it a lot: it decreases overfitting, reduces training time, makes models simpler, lifts the curse of dimensionality (partialy) and may even improve accuracy. There are dozens of FS methods, grouped by types (filter, wrapper, embedded), but I'll use simple and effective ones. The reason: I don't want to loose very much data and don't want wait for hours evaluating feature subsets. Check [this page](https://h2o.ai/wiki/feature-selection/) for more info on FS."
